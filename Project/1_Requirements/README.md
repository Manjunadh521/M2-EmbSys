## State of art/ Research
 Today's world is highly reliable on teachnology.Even the world around us is in our smart phone.So it would be good if we automate our own from any corner of the world.
 Here comes the requirement of our project where we can control our home with our smartphone from anywhere from the world.This is a boon to us where we can get an option
