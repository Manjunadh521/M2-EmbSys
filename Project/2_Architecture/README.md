## Keypad:
* Provides an interface to press a number which helps in controlling Fan,Light and Doors of our house.
## Motor Driver Unit:
* Helps in driving the motor for our door and fan by providing required power for them.
## Front Stop Switch(MicroSwitch):
* Stops the door automatically by pressing switch itself when door is completely opened.
## Back Stop Switch(MicroSwitch):
* Stops the door automatically by pressing switch itself when door is completely opened.                                                             
## Clock:
* We are using internal clock of our micro controller.
## EEPROM:
* Memory module of Micro controller.
## LCD Display:
* Displays each and every value we enter in our keypad along with Temperature.
## Sensor(Light Detection):
* Helps to check the intensity of light in the room.
## Sensor(Temperature Detector):
* Helps to detect the temperature in the room.
## Light:
* Lightning inside the room is controlled by light.
## Fan:
* Temperature inside room is controlled by fan.
## MicroController:
* This is the main component which controls all the above mentioned part or thins of our embedded system.This interfaces keypad and LCD and controlls the fan,light and doors depending on the value we pressed on keypad.
