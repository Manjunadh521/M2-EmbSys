## Case Study 2:
## SDRAM
* This is a dynamic random access memory which is synchronised with clock speed for which our microcontroller is optimised
* This helps in accepting new data before finishing the processing of previous data 
## DDR Termination Regulator:
* These are power regulators that helps us conserving the power by conserving the rapidly increasing and decreasing currents.
DDR operates at very high switching speed thus bus termination resistors are needed to control the impedance of the clock lines.
## Analog audio,video Interface:
* VGA Port:Used to interface with the devices having graphic cards
* ypbpr or AV cables:Convert analog audio and video from components such as TV,Phone and PC's and convert it to HDMI signal.
## HDMI Port:
* A High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port used to receive and transmit both video signals and audio signals from source devices to a number of display monitors.
## Storage Interfaces:
* SD Card,USB Port
## Audio Output:
* Speakers
* SPDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) is an audio transfer format interface. It transfers digital audio signals from one device to another without the need to first convert to an analog signal, which can degrade audio quality
## Back Light LED:
* Helps in enhancing the video output with RBG colour combination
## Light engine optic control
* The enhaced video content is projected out from lens with the combination of Red,Blue,Green light with Back light.This helps
to transmit our video to remmote locations
## Remote control(Radio frequency)
* Helps in interfacing with projector manually with keypad, LED'S and buttons
## Temperature sensor
* Detects over heating and Switch offs the projector 
## Discretes
* Discrete devices are single semiconductors like diodes or transistors helps to regulate voltages, helps in lower power consumption, and reduce heat generation.
